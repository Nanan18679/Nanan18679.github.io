  <h1>Y Combinator Database</h1>

  <h2>📌 Project Purpose</h2>
  <p>This project explores startups funded by Y Combinator by creating a structured SQL database that stores detailed information about each company — like where they’re based, what industry they’re in, and the backgrounds of their founders. By organizing and analyzing the data using SQL, we aim to answer questions such as: What kinds of founders tend to build successful startups? Are certain industries or locations more likely to produce active companies? The goal is to turn raw data into useful insights that could help investors, researchers, or anyone curious about the startup world better understand what drives success in the YC ecosystem.</p>

  <p>This dataset could benefit several types of users:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Venture Capital Firms & Angel Investors</strong> can use the data to spot patterns in successful startups, evaluate founder backgrounds, and identify promising investment opportunities.</li>
    <li><strong>Market Research Companies</strong> might use it to track industry trends, produce startup ecosystem reports, and monitor how YC companies have evolved over time.</li>
    <li><strong>Large Tech Companies</strong> looking for acquisitions could use the database to discover potential targets based on location, industry, or team composition.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📂 Data Source</h2>
  <p>The data for this project was sourced from the publicly available Kaggle dataset titled <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sashakorovkina/ycombinator-all-funded-companies-dataset" target="_blank">YCombinator: All Funded Companies</a>. The dataset contains detailed information about companies funded by Y Combinator including founders, industries, regions, and prior experience.</p>
  <h2>🧱 Stage 1: Design a Conceptual Data Model</h2>

  <h3>Entity Identification & Overview</h3>
  <p>Based on the original Kaggle dataset, eight CSV files were consolidated into six core entities through data wrangling in Excel: COMPANY, FOUNDER, REGIONS, INDUSTRY, COMPANY_EXPERIENCE, and SCHOOLS. Each entity represents a real-world concept relevant to the YC startup ecosystem and serves as the foundation of our conceptual schema.</p>

  <h3>Metadata Documentation</h3>
  <p>Metadata was developed at both the entity and attribute level. Each table contains details such as attribute names, data types, allowed values, and example entries. This ensures data integrity, consistency, and clarity for SQL querying.</p>

  <h4>Entity-Level Metadata</h4>
  <img src="images/yc/entity_level_metadata.png" alt="Entity Level Metadata" style="width:100%; max-width:800px; margin-bottom:20px; border:1px solid #ccc;">

  <h4>Attribute-Level Metadata</h4>
  <h5>COMPANY</h5>
  <img src="images/yc/company_attribute_metadata.png" alt="Company Attribute Metadata" style="width:100%; max-width:800px; margin-bottom:20px; border:1px solid #ccc;">
  <h5>FOUNDER</h5>
  <img src="images/yc/founder_attribute_metadata.png" alt="Founder Attribute Metadata" style="width:100%; max-width:800px; margin-bottom:20px; border:1px solid #ccc;">
  <h5>REGIONS</h5>
  <img src="images/yc/regions_attribute_metadata.png" alt="Regions Attribute Metadata" style="width:100%; max-width:800px; margin-bottom:20px; border:1px solid #ccc;">
  <h5>INDUSTRY</h5>
  <img src="images/yc/industries_attribute_metadata.png" alt="Industries Attribute Metadata" style="width:100%; max-width:800px; margin-bottom:20px; border:1px solid #ccc;">
  <h5>COMPANY_EXPERIENCE</h5>
  <img src="images/yc/company_experience_attribute_metadata.png" alt="Company Experience Attribute Metadata" style="width:100%; max-width:800px; margin-bottom:20px; border:1px solid #ccc;">
  <h5>SCHOOLS</h5>
  <img src="images/yc/schools_attribute_metadata.png" alt="Schools Attribute Metadata" style="width:100%; max-width:800px; margin-bottom:20px; border:1px solid #ccc;">

  <h3>Entity Relationships & Business Rules</h3>
  <p>Relationships were mapped based on logical connections between entities. For example, a FOUNDER can attend many SCHOOLS, and each COMPANY belongs to one INDUSTRY. The business rules were formalized to reflect cardinality and data dependencies.</p>

  <h4>ER Diagram & Relationship Matrix</h4>
  <img src="images/yc/erd_and_relationship.png" alt="ERD and Relationship" style="width:100%; max-width:500px; margin-bottom:20px; border:1px solid #ccc;">
  
  <h4>Business Rules</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>For Industry entity:</strong> Each Industry may have multiple Sub_Industries, but a Sub_Industry must belong to exactly one Industry. This rule prevents a Sub_Industry from existing without being associated with an Industry.</li>
    <li><strong>For Founder entity:</strong> Each Founder must have a unique HN_ID assigned to them. This rule prevents any registration from inserting a Founder without an HN_ID or with a duplicate HN_ID.</li>
    <li><strong>For Company entity:</strong> Each Company must have a unique Company_ID that serves as its identifier. This rule causes any attempt to insert a Company without a Company_ID or with a duplicate Company_ID to be rejected.</li>
    <li><strong>For Region entity:</strong> Each Company must belong to exactly one Region, and each Region must have an associated State, Country, and City. This rule enforces that no company can exist without being assigned a Region and ensures complete geographical data for every company on Y Combinator.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h4>💡 Relationship Refinement Example: FOUNDER & SCHOOL via DIPLOMA</h4>
  <p>Originally, a many-to-many relationship existed between <strong>FOUNDER</strong> and <strong>SCHOOL</strong>. To normalize this relationship and better capture attributes such as degree type, a bridge entity <strong>DIPLOMA</strong> was introduced.</p>
  <img src="images/yc/refinement_example.png" alt="Refinement Example" style="width:100%; max-width:400px; margin-bottom:20px; border:1px solid #ccc;">
  <ul>
    <li>A <strong>FOUNDER</strong> can earn <strong>one or many DIPLOMAs</strong>.</li>
    <li>A <strong>SCHOOL</strong> can issue <strong>many DIPLOMAs</strong> to different founders.</li>
    <li>Each <strong>DIPLOMA</strong> is associated with <strong>exactly one SCHOOL</strong> and <strong>exactly one FOUNDER</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🧱 Stage 2: Design a Logical Data Model</h2>
  <p>This relational schema shows how each entity was mapped into SQL tables, including attributes, data types, and primary/foreign key constraints. It reflects how the conceptual design was translated into an implementable database structure.</p>
  <img src="images/yc/relational_data_model.png" alt="Relational Data Model" style="width:100%; max-width:800px; margin-bottom:20px; border:1px solid #ccc;">
  
  <p>This stage transforms the conceptual model into a relational schema that can be implemented in SQL. Primary keys and foreign key relationships are defined to enforce referential integrity.</p>
  
  <h4>Normalization: Full Functional Dependencies</h4>
